## Usage

All frontend commands can be run from the project root:

- `npm start` — Start the Expo app
- `npm run android` — Run on Android
- `npm run ios` — Run on iOS
- `npm run web` — Run on web
- `npm run lint` — Lint the frontend code

Or, run commands directly in the `frontend/` directory as before.

Add your backend code to the `backend/` directory.
